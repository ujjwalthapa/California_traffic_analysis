There are 2 distinct challenges. The first is identifying the stations in the traffic stations data that report traffic conditions on these roadways. The second is building a decent prediction model to estimate traffic volume. A third challenge would be to determine the impact to commute time based on traffic flow which I will save for a later date (you can do this by bringing t[ransit time data from HERE API](https://developer.here.com/).\n\nTwo things stand out to me in this process. First, *a machine learning project is not linear.* As much as I want this notebook to read as a story, the process was back and forth for days. Explore, learn, go back & revise, explore, learn, go back and revise. While the Hands-On text includes all that back and forth, the notebook below only keeps the final methods. Second, *repeatability in the proces is critical for time-saving*. There is a section on writing custom transformers in SciKit Learn which is unreal.

Standardization is quite different: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized values always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the variance so that the resulting distribution has unit variance. Unlike min-max scaling, standardization does not bound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algorithms (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1).

This is significantly lower than our benchmark of 979 (which used historical medians of weekday and month).

For starters, the next chapter of Hands-On goes through a similar process but for classiciaftion models (categorical dependent variable). However, as an add-on to the above there are a few immediate possibilities. Find more historical data and try to improve the results. Find historical data for the other roadways in Minneapolis that we wanted to predict traffic volume on. Another idea is to try the same thing for roadways in other parts of the country. Finally, HERE API provides transit time data that we could use to model the relationship between traffic volume and what we all refer to as 'traffic.'"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2becb28f536db672c10c5ce8e6046af0e439703c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c9647832d6c9f30d1f733b36abd4edfb4919d4f0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
